# MvM-Cash-Exploit-Fix

Edit: This was fixed on the 03-01-2023 TF2 update, but it is still possible to spam the command and the accompanying sound cue, which this plugin fixes.

Fixes an oversight with the td_buyback command leading to infinite money

Just blocks the command when the player has no class~

Issue was reported here, Valve just needs to add a class check where this command is used :>
